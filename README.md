# Helm chart for deploying k-orc

Automatic construction of a Helm chart for https://github.com/k-orc/openstack-resource-controller

This repository generates a helm chart from the manifest provided in the official repository https://github.com/k-orc/openstack-resource-controller

Steps for generating the helm are as follows:
- download the official install.yaml from `https://github.com/k-orc/openstack-resource-controller/releases/`
- Add some patches with kustomize to add few elements:
  - configurable namespace
  - additionnal env variables: `http_proxy` needed to use corporate proxy
- use helmify, to generate a helm chart

A branch containing the helm charts is generated by tag from the k-orc repo

```
# Generate helm chart for v2.2.0 branch
git checkout -b v2.2.0
./scripts/update.sh v2.2.0
git commit -m "update: v2.2.0"
git push
```
